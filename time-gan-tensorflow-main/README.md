# Brembo Hackathon



### Description
- Attempted Challenge 1

### Created
- Created a Long-Short Term Memory Model (LSTM) based on the dataset provided in challenge1_data.csv. The LSTM is able to make predictions about the future. The higher the epochs, the more refined the predictions. LSTM is able to make predictions based on multiple variables and also output predictions for all of those variables as well. 



### Hackathon Challenge Options:

1. Gen AI & Brake Pad Recipe Creation

Using friction test data provided by Brembo, use Generative AI to create new compounds, forecast testing results and create the framework for predicting the effectiveness and characteristics of a new Brembo brake product. The data provided will include a list of compounds previously used and tested by Brembo, as well as their outcomes. Solutions must be based on Generative AI, applied to provide a model able to propose new recipes that increase the number of candidate compounds, ensuring feasibility and good performances.


2. Synthetic Data for Warranty Classification

 Based on a historical Warranty Database, which includes a set of claims from customers, generate synthetic data that can augment Brembo’s data set, retrain the current production model, and determine if there is improvement in the final classifier. The synthetic data that is generated should resemble the data that Brembo is providing, and should be used to improve Brembo’s existing model.
